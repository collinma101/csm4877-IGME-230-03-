# The Heart of Iron
## I. High Concept
The Heart of Iron is a thriling new puzzle adventure game is Minecraft meets steampunk. Take the role of Shinra Aki, a young girl on a desperate mission to discover her family's dark history. With nothing but her father's amulet;  build, break, and battle your way to the Heart of Iron, a mythical artifact said to grant its user the power to control the world.
## II. Genre
This game is mainly a puzzle and adventure game, with some action and fighting every now and then. 
## III. Platform
The game is intended to run for desktop-only, but this is subject to change. I want to make it an app, but currently I do not have the knowledge to accomplish this, if I am adequately informed about mobile development by the time we create the project, I will definitely strive to try and make it mobile friendly. 
## IV, Story
The story begins on the shores of a mysterious island, where the main protagonist, Shinra Aki first lands. She is set in motion by a hint by an unknown figure to seek the Heart of Iron to discover the truth about her family, who vanished abruptly when she was a child. Using her father's amulet, Aki finds that she can control machina; constructs which are scattered across the island, either in tact or in pieces. After being attacked by another machina, she finds out that there is someone or something else that can as well. 
The theme is creation and discovery, and the player is motivated by the discovery of new schematics to create new machina or upgrade their existing ones, as well as the story. 
## V. Aesthetics
The graphics are intended to be cartoonish or an anime artstyle. Most of the sound will be ambient and zone, with some differing sounds for machinas. The sounds will be simple, probably some metal bash sounds for combat and the creation of new machinas. There will be ambient(probably piano music) music in the background. 
## VI. Gameplay
The player controls Aki through the keyboard and mouse. The entire goal of the game is to progress forward(I'd like to try and do this without making the game a platformer, but it might be that style), and this is done through the creation of different machinas to aid you on your adventure. Using various parts, either found of looted from defeating enemy machina, the player can create different types of machina, some to fight and some specfically created to improve player QoL or solve puzzles. The type of machina a player can create is limited to what schematics they have discovered, so as the player progresses through the game, they will be able to create much more powerful and impressive machina. For example, there could be a puzzle where the player must jump and navigate to a location, and then there they could discover a schematic for a machina that allows the player to teleport a short distance, and therefore, if a similar puzzle appears, the player would now be better prepared.
